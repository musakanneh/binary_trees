# Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

## Difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure.htm). On the other hand, in a binary search trees, A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

## Important Terms [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure.htm)
Following are the important terms with respect to tree.
- Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
- Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
- Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
- Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
- Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
- Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
- Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
- Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
- Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
- keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
